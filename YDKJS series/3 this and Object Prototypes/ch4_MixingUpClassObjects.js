//Classes describe a way for organizing the code in order to model it as a real world problem.
//Thus, through data structures, classes help us to operate on data and package it up along with a certain behavior (a.k.a. Encapsulate).
//It's possible to classify data structures by thinking about any given structure as a specific variation of a more general base definition.
